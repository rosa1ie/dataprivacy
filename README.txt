Before running the code, you must install phe and numpy using "pip install phe numpy".
You can run files by this order, Utility.py, all the files except Graph.py and Accuracy&Result.py, and then Accuracy&Result.py.
Please run Utility.py once only when you change count so the three files are getting the same list of numbers.
Please close all the taps on your computer and make sure to use only one computer to compare each runtime.
You can also install pandas and matplotlib to get pdf file of graph.
